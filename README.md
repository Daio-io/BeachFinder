# BeachFinder

What started out as a little hack around with RXSwift I am now turning into an app

#### You can leave at this point... this is for me

So, TODO:

- Scan range seek bar styling
- Icon assets

Long game:

- Create settings page for custom setup
- Switch to a remote config solution if needed
- Add my beaches section
- Ability to search for beach by name
- Show data over few days

Server side:

- More beaches (international)
