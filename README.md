# BeachFinder

What started out as a little hack around with RXSwift I am now turning into an app

#### You can leave at this point... this is for me

So, TODO:

- Scan range seek bar styling
- Refactor services
- Create Config
- Create view binder interfaces to pass to views and tidy up Observable binding logic
- Icon assets
- Create about page

Long game:

- Add my beaches section
- Ability to search for beach by name
- Show data over few days

Server side:

- More beaches (international)
