#### You can leave at this point... this is for me

Long game:

- Break out ui components into separate views and xib's for reuse
- Create settings page for custom setup
- Switch to a remote config solution if needed
- Ability to search for beach by name
- Show data over few days
- Scan range seek bar styling - maybe do something further with this?

Server side:

- More beaches (international)
